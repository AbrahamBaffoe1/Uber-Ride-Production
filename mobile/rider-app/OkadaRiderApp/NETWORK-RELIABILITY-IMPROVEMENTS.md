# Network Reliability Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to enhance network reliability and error handling in the Okada Rider App. These changes address the issues observed in the error logs where API requests were failing with "No response from server" errors, socket connections were not properly initializing, and authentication tokens were not being consistently accessed.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Network Service

A new `EnhancedNetworkService` has been implemented that provides:

- **Robust Network Status Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network connectivity status using NetInfo
- **Caching Strategy**: Implements various caching policies for API requests:
  - `cache-first`: Checks cache before making a network request
  - `cache-only`: Only uses cached data (useful for offline mode)
  - `network-only`: Always fetches fresh data
  - `cache-and-network`: Uses cache for immediate display, then updates with network data

This service helps maintain app functionality during intermittent connectivity issues or when backend services are temporarily unavailable.

**Location**: `src/services/enhanced-network.service.ts`

### 2. Authentication Constants

We've standardized authentication token storage by:

- Creating a constants file for auth-related keys
- Using these constants consistently across all services
- Ensuring the same token key names are used everywhere

This prevents issues where some components were using different storage keys like 'auth_token' vs 'authToken', which caused authentication failures.

**Location**: `src/constants/auth.ts`

### 3. Updated API Service Integration

Key services have been updated to use the enhanced network capabilities:

- **Daily Earnings Service**: Now uses cache-first strategy with fallback data
- **Rider Stats Service**: Implements caching with graceful degradation 
- **Socket Service**: Improved with:
  - Consistent auth token references
  - Transport fallback (websocket â†’ polling)
  - Network-aware reconnection strategy
  - Smarter error handling

### 4. Network Status Indicator

The UI component that shows network status has been updated to:

- Work with the new enhanced network service
- Support the 'limited' connectivity state
- Provide better visual feedback about connectivity

**Location**: `src/components/common/NetworkStatusIndicator.tsx`

### 5. WebSocket Connection Reliability

To address the specific socket connection errors that were occurring, we've made these improvements:

- **Transport Fallback**: Automatically switches from WebSocket to polling when WebSocket connection fails
- **Connection Parameters**: Increased timeout and added more robust configuration
- **Safer Property Access**: Added null checks to prevent TypeScript errors
- **Network-Aware Reconnection**: Checks network status before attempting reconnection to avoid futile reconnect attempts
- **Controlled Reconnection**: Added delays between reconnection attempts to prevent rapid connection cycling

## How It Works

### Request Flow

1. When a component needs data (e.g., daily earnings), it calls the appropriate service
2. The service uses the enhanced network service with a specified caching strategy
3. If online, the request goes through normally
4. If offline or if the request fails:
   - For GET requests: The service returns cached data if available
   - For critical data: The service returns fallback data that looks realistic

### Fallback Mechanism

For critical data that should always be available to the user (like earnings), we've implemented fallback data generation that:

- Creates realistic-looking placeholder data
- Ensures the UI doesn't break when backend services are unavailable
- Clearly indicates to the user when they're viewing cached/offline data

### Authentication Flow

1. The app now consistently uses the same storage keys for auth tokens
2. All services reference these constants instead of hardcoded strings
3. This ensures that when a user logs in, all services can access the same token

## Testing

To test these improvements:

1. Run the app with a stable internet connection
2. Enable airplane mode or disable network connectivity
3. Verify that:
   - The app displays a network status indicator
   - Critical screens continue to function with cached or fallback data
   - When connectivity is restored, fresh data is loaded

## Future Improvements

1. **Offline Queue**: Implement a system to queue write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) performed while offline
2. **Sync Manager**: Add a background sync service to reconcile local and server data when connectivity is restored
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Develop strategies for handling conflicts when offline changes conflict with server state
4. **WebSocket Protocol Upgrade**: Consider implementing a more robust WebSocket solution that includes features like:
   - Automatic keep-alive messages to prevent connection timeouts
   - Binary message format for reduced data usage
   - Session resumption capabilities for better reconnection
5. **Server-Side Improvements**: Recommend server-side changes to better handle connection scaling and reliability
